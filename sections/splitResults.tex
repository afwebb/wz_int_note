A separate maximum-likelihood fit is performed over the 1-jet and 2-jet fit regions in order to extract the best-fit value of the WZ + $b$ and WZ + $c$ jet contributions. The $WZ$ + b, $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light contributions are allowed to float, with the remaining background contributions are held fixed. \textbf{The current fit strategy treats the WZ + $b$ contribution as the parameter of interest, with the normalization of the $WZ$ + charm and the $WZ$ + light contributions taken as systematic uncertainties. This could however be adjusted, depending on whether it is decided the goal of the analysis should be to measure WZ + $b$ specifically or WZ + heavy flavor overall.} The result of the fit is used to extract the cross-section of $WZ$ + heavy-flavor production.

A maximum likelihood fit to data is performed simultaneously in the regions described in Section \ref{sec:evt_selection}. The parameters $\mu_{WZ+b}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm}$, $\mu_{WZ+light}$, where $\mu = \sigma_{observed}/\sigma_{SM} $, are extracted from the fit.

%While in the nominal fit events with an intermediate top quark are treated as a separate process, an alternative version of the measurement is performed which considers tZ as part of the signal.

The Asimov fit for 1-jet events gives an expected $\mu$ value of $1.00^{+0.37}_{-0.35}(stat)^{+0.24}_{-0.22}(sys)$ for $WZ$ + b. The fitted cross-section modifiers for $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light are $1.00 \pm 0.17 \pm 0.15$ and $1.00 \pm 0.04 \pm 0.07 $, respectively.

The expected cross-section of WZ + $b$ with 1 associated jet obtained from the fit is $1.74^{+0.65}_{-0.61}(stat)^{+0.42}_{-0.37}(sys)$ fb with an expected significance of 2.2$\sigma$. The expected cross-sectin of WZ + $c$ is measured to be $14.6 \pm 2.5 (stat) \pm 2.1 (sys)$ fb, with a correlation of -0.23. 


For 2-jet events, the fit gives an expected $\mu$ value of $1.00^{+0.34}_{-0.33}(stat)^{+0.29}_{-0.28}(sys)$ for $WZ$ + b. The fitted cross-section modifiers for $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light are $1.00 \pm 0.17 \pm 0.15$ and $1.00 \pm 0.04 \pm 0.08 $, respectively.

The expected $WZ$ + b cross-section in the 2-jet region is $2.46^{+0.83}_{-0.81}(stat)^{+0.0.73}_{-0.68}(sys)$ fb with an expected significance of 2.6$\sigma$. The 2-jet expected cross-section of $WZ$ + charm is $12.7 \pm 2.2 (stat) \pm 2.0 (sys)$ fb, and the correlation between WZ + $c$ and WZ + $b$ is -0.26.

As described in Section \ref{sec:sys}, there are 226 systematic uncertainties that are considered as NPs in the fit. These NPs are constrained by Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The latter are used for normalisation factors to ensure that they are always positive. The expected number of signal and background events are functions of the likelihood. The prior for each NP is added as a penalty term, decreasing the likelihood as it is shifted away from its nominal value. 

The impact of each NP is calculated by performing the fit with the parameter of interest held fixed, varied from its fitted value by its uncertainty, and calculating $\Delta\mu$ relative to the baseline fit.  The impact of the most significant sources of systematic uncertainties is summarized in Table \ref{tab:systematics_1j}.

The pie charts in Figure \ref{fig:pie_chart_1j} show that for the modelling uncertainties that contribute most correspond to the most significant backgrounds. %The pileup-reweighting and luminosity play a significant role as well, because, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pie_chart_1j}, the signal purity is relatively small in each of the fit regions. This means that a small scaling in the background contribution resulting from a change in luminosity or pileup corresponds to a significant change in the best fit signal contribution.

The negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+charm}$ and $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ are expected: $WZ$ + charm is present in both the $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light enriched regions, therefore increasing the fraction of charm requires increasing the fraction of $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light. This reasoning also explains the positive correlation between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$. 

Two of the major backgrounds in the region with the highest purity of $WZ$ + b are tZ and Other VV + b, explaining the negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and the tZ cross section, and the VV + b cross section.

The high correlation between the luminosity and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ arises from the fact that the uncertainty on $\mu_{WZ+light}$ is very low (around 4\%). Small changes in luminosity cause a change in the yield of $WZ$ + light that is large compared to its uncertainty, producing a large correlation between these two parameters. 

%The other significant correlation present is between ATLAS FTAG L0 and $\mu_{WZ + light}$ and $\mu_{WZ+ charm}$. This shifts the
