The working points discussed in section \ref{subsec:bjets} are used to separate events into fit regions based on the highest working point reached by a jet in each event. Because the background composition differs significantly based on the number of b-jets, events are further subdivided into 1 jet and 2 jet regions in order to minimize the impact of background uncertainties. 

The two jet regions which fall within the tightest MV2c10 working points, between 70\%-60\% and 60\%, are left out of the fit. These regions are found to be dominated by leptonically decaying $t\bar{t}$ with an additional fake lepton. Because these regions add little statistical significance to the measurement while introducing large systematic uncertainties because of the prescence of a fake lepton, these regions are not included.

An additional tZ control region is created based on the BDT described in section \ref{sec:tZ_bdt}. The region with 1-jet passing the 60\% working point is split in two - a signal enriched region of events with a BDT score greater than 0.03, and a tZ control region including events with less than 0.03. This cutoff is arrived at by performing an Asimov fit with a variety of cutoffs, and selecting the value that produces the highest significance for the measurement of $WZ$ + b.
