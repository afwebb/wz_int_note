An alternative fit is performed which combines the WZ + 1-jet and WZ + 2-jet samples rather than fitting them independently. This is done primarily as a cross-check of the nominal analysis, to see if measuring 1-jet and 2-jet events separately and combining them gives drastically different results than measuring them together. 

For this study, three signal templates, WZ + $b$, WZ + $c$ and WZ + light, are fit to data, and the systematics accounting for migrations between 1-jet and 2-jet bins are removed. All other background and nuiscance parameters remain the same as the nominal fit. 

The measured $\mu$ value for WZ + $b$ is  $\mu = 1.00^{+0.30}_{-0.29}(stat)^{+0.25}_{-0.23}(sys)$, with a significance of 2.8$\sigma$, and the uncertainty on WZ + $c$ is $\mu = 1.00\pm 0.12 (stat)\pm 0.13 (sys)$. This is compared to combined uncertainty of $\mu = 1.00^{+0.32}_{-0.30}(stat)^{+0.24}_{-0.23}(sys)$ for WZ + $b$ when 1-jet and 2-jet events are measured separately and then combined.

A post-fit summary plot of the fit regions is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fit_results_inc}:
