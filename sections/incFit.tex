An alternate fit is performed which combines the WZ + 1-jet and WZ + 2-jet samples rather than fitting them independently. This is done primarily as a cross-check of the nominal analysis, to see if measuring 1-jet and 2-jet events separately and combining them gives drastically different results than measuring them together. 

For this study, three signal templates, WZ + b, WZ + charm and WZ + light, are fit to data, and the systematics accounting for migrations between 1-jet and 2-jet bins are removed. All other background and nuiscance parameters remain the same as the nominal fit. 

The measured uncertainty of WZ + b is X \%, with a significance of X$\sigma$, and the uncertainty on WZ + charm is X. This is compared to combined uncertainty of X\% for WZ + b and X\% for WZ + charm when 1-jet and 2-jet events are measured separately and then combined.

A post-fit summary plot of the fit regions is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fit_results_inc}:
