\subsection{Fit Procedure}
\label{sec:fit}

A maximum-likelihood fit is performed over the total yields in the various fit regions described in Section \ref{sec:evt_selection} in order to extract the best-fit value of the WZ + $b$ and WZ + $c$ jet contributions for events with both 1 and 2 associated jets.

Because the fit regions are defined by the number of associated jets at reco-level, the signal is split into separate samples based on the number of truth jets in order to account for differences in the number of truth jets compared to the number of reco-jets. The WZ + $b$, WZ + $c$ and $WZ$ + light contributions are separated into independent samples based on the number of truth jets in each event. WZ + 1 truth-jet and WZ + 2 truth-jets are treated as signal samples, while WZ + 0 truth-jets and WZ + $>=$3 truth-jets are treated as an additional background. 

A maximum likelihood fit to data is performed simultaneously in the regions described in Section \ref{sec:evt_selection}, summarized in figure \ref{fig:summary}. The six signal templates, which include WZ + $b$ 1-jet, WZ + $c$ 1-jet, WZ+ light 1-jet, WZ + $b$ 2-jets, WZ + $c$ 2-jets, WZ + light 2-jets, are allowed to float, while the remaining background contributions are held fixed. The parameters $\mu_{WZ+b - 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+light - 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+b - 2-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm 2-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+light - 2-jet}$, where $\mu = \sigma_{observed}/\sigma_{SM} $, are extracted from the fit. A simultaneous fit is performed over all 1-jet and 2-jet regions.

\end{figure}

As described in Section \ref{sec:sys}, there are 230 systematic uncertainties that are considered as NPs in the fit. These NPs are constrained by Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The latter are used for normalisation factors to ensure that they are always positive. The expected number of signal and background events are functions of the likelihood. The prior for each NP is added as a penalty term, decreasing the likelihood as it is shifted away from its nominal value.

Several alternate fit strategies are documented in Appendices \ref{sec:incFit}-\ref{sec:inc_tZ}. These include a measurement of WZ + 1 or 2 jets inclusively, a fit where tZ is allowed to float, and a case where tZ is included as part of the signal.

\subsection{Results of the Simultaneous Fit}
\label{sec:resSum}

The results of the Asimov fit for the fiducial regions considered, including both the normalization factors as well as the expected cross-sections, along with their uncertainties, are summarized in Table \ref{tab:WZ_results}.

An expected significance of 2.0$\sigma$ is observed for WZ + $b$ with 1-jet, and 1.7$\sigma$ for WZ + $b$ with two jets. A summary of the correlations between these various measurements is shown in Figure \ref{fig:corrMat}.

The impact of each NP is calculated by performing the fit with the parameter of interest held fixed, varied from its fitted value by its uncertainty, and calculating $\Delta\mu$ relative to the baseline fit.  The impact of the most significant sources of systematic uncertainties on WZ + $b$ and WZ + $c$ with one associated jet are summarized in Table \ref{tab:systematics_1j}.

\end{table}

%The large impact of the Jet Energy Scale and Jet Flavor Tagging is unsurprising, as the shape of the fit regions depends heavily on the modeling of the jets. The other major sources of uncertainty come from background modelling and cross-section uncertainty. %The pie charts in Figure \ref{fig:pie_chart_1j} show that for the modelling uncertainties that contribute most correspond to the most significant backgrounds. 

%The negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+charm}$ and $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ are expected: $WZ$ + charm is present in both the $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light enriched regions, therefore increasing the fraction of charm requires increasing the fraction of $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light. This reasoning also explains the positive correlation between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$. 

%Two of the major backgrounds in the region with the highest purity of $WZ$ + b are tZ and Other VV + b, explaining the negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and the tZ cross section, and the VV + b cross section.

%The high correlation between the luminosity and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ arises from the fact that the uncertainty on $\mu_{WZ+light}$ is very low (around 4\%). Small changes in luminosity cause a change in the yield of $WZ$ + light that is large compared to its uncertainty, producing a large correlation between these two parameters. 

The impact of the most significant systematic uncertainties on the 2-jet fiducial regions are summarized in Table \ref{tab:systematics_2j}.
