\subsection{Fit Procedure}
\label{sec:fit}

A maximum-likelihood fit is performed over the various fit regions described in Section \ref{sec:evt_selection} in order to extract the best-fit value of the WZ + b-jet and WZ + charm jet contributions for events with both 1 and 2 associated jets.

Because the fit regions are defined by the number of associated jets at reco-level, an unfolding procedure is applied to the signal in order to account for differences in the number of truth jets compared to the number of reco-jets. The $WZ$ + b, $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light contributions are separated into independent samples based on the number of truth jets in each event. WZ + 1 truth-jet and WZ + 2 truth-jets are treated as signal samples, while WZ + 0 truth-jets and WZ + $>=$3 truth-jets are treated as an additional background. 

A maximum likelihood fit to data is performed simultaneously in the regions described in Section \ref{sec:evt_selection}, summarized in figure \ref{fig:summary}. The six signal templates, which include WZ+b 1-jet, WZ+c 1-jet, WZ+l 1-jet, WZ+b 2-jets, WZ+c 2-jets, WZ+l 2-jets, are allowed to float, while the remaining background contributions are held fixed. The parameters $\mu_{WZ+b - 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+light - 1-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+b - 2-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm 2-jet}$, $\mu_{WZ+light - 2-jet}$, where $\mu = \sigma_{observed}/\sigma_{SM} $, are extracted from the fit. A simultaneous fit is performed over all 1-jet and 2-jet regions.

\end{figure}

As described in Section \ref{sec:sys}, there are 229 systematic uncertainties that are considered as NPs in the fit. These NPs are constrained by Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The latter are used for normalisation factors to ensure that they are always positive. The expected number of signal and background events are functions of the likelihood. The prior for each NP is added as a penalty term, decreasing the likelihood as it is shifted away from its nominal value. The correlations between these nuisance parameters are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:corr_mat_1j}. 

The result of the fit is used to extract the cross-section of $WZ$ + heavy-flavor production in the fiducial region defined below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Three light leptons with total charge $\pm$1
\item One OSSF lepton pair with $|M(ll)-91.2\ GeV| < 10\ GeV|$
\item One or two associated jets with $p_T >$25 GeV
\end{itemize}

Several alternate fit strategies are documented in Appendices \ref{sec:incFit}-\ref{sec:inc_tZ}. These include a measurement of WZ + 1 or 2 jets inclusively, a fit where tZ is allowed to float, and a case where tZ is included as part of the signal.

\subsection{Independent 1-jet and 2-jet Results}
\label{sec:resSum}

The Asimov fit for 1-jet events gives an expected $\mu$ value of $1.00^{+0.47}_{-0.43}(stat)^{+0.30}_{-0.27}(sys)$ for $WZ$ + b. The fitted cross-section modifiers for $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light are $1.00 \pm 0.17 \pm 0.17$ and $1.00 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.14 $, respectively.

The expected cross-section of WZ+b with 1-jet is $1.74^{+0.82}_{-0.75}(stat)^{+0.53}_{-0.48}(sys)$ fb, and $14.6 \pm 2.5 (stat) \pm 2.3 (sys)$ fb for WZ + charm, with a correlation of -0.15 between them. An expected significance of 2.0 is observed for WZ + b in this region. 

For 2-jet events, the fit gives an expected $\mu$ value of $1.00^{+0.53}_{-0.51}(stat)^{+0.39}_{-0.34}(sys)$ for $WZ$ + b. The fitted cross-section modifiers for $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light are $1.00 \pm 0.25 \pm 0.21$ and $1.00 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.16 $, respectively.

The expected $WZ$ + b cross-section in the 2-jet region is $2.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}(stat)^{+0.95}_{-0.83}(sys)$ fb with an expected significance of 1.7$\sigma$. The 2-jet expected cross-section of $WZ$ + charm is $12.7 \pm 3.2 (stat) \pm 2.7 (sys)$ fb, and the correlation between WZ + charm and WZ + b is -0.22. 

A summary of the correlation between the various WZ components is summarized in Table \ref{tab:WZ_corr}.

The impact of each NP is calculated by performing the fit with the parameter of interest held fixed, varied from its fitted value by its uncertainty, and calculating $\Delta\mu$ relative to the baseline fit.  The impact of the most significant sources of systematic uncertainties on WZ + b with one associated jet is summarized in Table \ref{tab:systematics_1j}.

The large impact of the Jet Energy Scale and Jet Flavor Tagging is unsurprising, as the shape of the fit regions depends heavily on the modeling of the jets. The other major sources of uncertainty come from background modelling and cross-section uncertainty. %The pie charts in Figure \ref{fig:pie_chart_1j} show that for the modelling uncertainties that contribute most correspond to the most significant backgrounds. 

%The negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+charm}$ and $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ are expected: $WZ$ + charm is present in both the $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light enriched regions, therefore increasing the fraction of charm requires increasing the fraction of $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light. This reasoning also explains the positive correlation between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$. 

%Two of the major backgrounds in the region with the highest purity of $WZ$ + b are tZ and Other VV + b, explaining the negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and the tZ cross section, and the VV + b cross section.

%The high correlation between the luminosity and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ arises from the fact that the uncertainty on $\mu_{WZ+light}$ is very low (around 4\%). Small changes in luminosity cause a change in the yield of $WZ$ + light that is large compared to its uncertainty, producing a large correlation between these two parameters. 

Pre-fit yields in each of the 2-jet fit are shown in Figure \ref{tab:prefitYield2j}.
