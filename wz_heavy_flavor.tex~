\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The production of WZ in association with a heavy flavor jet represents an important test of the Standard Model. While measurements have been made of WZ production, WZ + heavy flavor remains poorly understood. This is in part because the QCD processes involved in the production of WZ + b-jet make it difficult to simulate accurately, introducing a large uncertainty for analyses that include it as a background. This includes any analysis with leptons and b-jets in the final state, such as $t\bar{t}H$, $t\bar{t}W$, and $t\bar{t}Z$. Motivated by its relevance to the $t\bar{t}H$ multilepton analysis, we perform a study of the fully leptonic decay mode of this channel.

The pseudo-continuous b-tagging spectrum of each event in a diboson enriched region is fit to data in order make a more accurate estimate of the contribution of WZ + heavy-flavor. The full 2015 + 2016 dataset collected by the ATLAS detector, representing 36.1 $fb^{-1}$ of data from pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, is used for this study.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data Samples and Event Selection}
\label{sec:evt_selection}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The study uses a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. It represents an integrated luminosity of 36.1 $fb^{-1}$. 

Several different generators were used to produce Monte Carlo simulations of the signal and background processes. For all samples, the response of the ATLAS detector is simulated using Geant4. The diboson samples are simulated using Sherpa 2.2.1 \cite{sherpa}. Specific information about the Monte Carlo samples being used can be found in table 1 of \cite{ttH_paper} .

Selected events are required to include exactly three reconstructed light leptons, which have a total charge of $\pm$1. As the opposite sign lepton is found to be prompt 97\% of the time \cite{ttH_paper}, it is required to be loose, while the same sign leptons must be very tight. All leptons are required to be isolated, and pass a non-prompt BDT selection described in \cite{ttH_paper}. The opposite sign lepton is required to have $p_T > 10$ GeV, while the same sign leptons are required to have $p_T > 20$ GeV to reduce the contribution of non-prompt leptons. The leptons must all fall within $|\eta| <$ 2.5.

The invariant mass of at least one pair of opposite sign, same flavor leptons is required to fall within 10 GeV of the Z mass. Events where one of the opposite sign pairs have an invariant mass less than 12 GeV are rejected in order to suppress low mass resonances. Further, events where the trilepton mass falls within 5 GeV of the Z mass are rejected to remove Z events that include conversions.

An additional requirement is placed on the transverse mass of the $W$ candidate, $m(E^{miss}_T + l_{other}) > 30$ GeV, where $EE^{miss}_T$ is the missing transverse energy, and $l_{other}$ is the lepton not included in he Z-candidate. 

Events are requied to have one or two reconstructed jets. Events with more than two jets are rejected in order to reduce the contribution of background such as $t\bar{t}Z$ and $t\bar{t}W$, which tend to have higher jet multiplicity. Jets are required to have $p_T > 25$ GeV, and must be within $|\eta| <$ 2.47.

\end{table}

The event yields for both data and Monte Carlo are summarized in table \ref{tab:evt_yields}, which shows good agreement between data and Monte Carlo, and demonstrates that this signal region consists primarily of diboson events.

Simulations are further validated by comparing the kinematic distributions they produce with data, which are shown in figure \ref{sr_kinematics}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{B-tagging}
\label{btagging}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make a measurement of WZ + b-jet it is necessary to distinguish these events from WZ + charm and WZ + light. For this purpose, the MV2c10 b-tagging algorithm is used to distinguish b-jets from lighter ones. The MV2c10 algorithm uses jet kinematics, particularly jet vertex information, as input for a BDT which assigns each jet a score designed to reflect how likely that jet is to have originated from a b-quark. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{MV2c10_output.png}
    \caption{Output distribution of the MV2c10 algorithm for b-jets, charm jets, and light jets}
    \label{fig:MV2c10}
\end{figure}

From the output of the BDT, working points are developed based on the efficiency of truth b-jets at particular values of the MV2c10 algorithm. The working points used in this analysis are summarized in table \ref{tab:btag_WPs}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}
    \hline
       WP &  none & loose & medium & tight & tightest\\
       \hline
     b eff. & - & 85\% & 77\% & 70\% & 60\% \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}    
    \caption{B-tagging Working Points by tightness and b-jet efficiency}
    \label{tab:btag_WPs}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

A tighter working point will accept fewer b-jets, but reject a higher fraction of charm and light jets as shown in figure \ref{fig:jet_rejection}. This means events with associated jets that fall under the loosest working points include a large fraction of WZ + light events, while the tighter working points include a much more pure sample of the signal, WZ + b.

\end{figure}

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:sys}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The systematic uncertainties that are considered are summarized in table \ref{tab:systematics}. These are implemented in the fit either as a normalization factors or as a shape variation or both in the signal and background estimations. The numerical impact of each of these uncertainties is outlined in section \ref{sec:results}.

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:SystSummary}
\end{table}

The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is derived from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016 \cite{lumi}.

The experimental uncertainties are related to the reconstruction and identification of light leptons and
 and b-tagging of jets, and to the reconstruction of $E^{miss}_T$. The sources which contribute to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale \cite{jes} are decomposed into uncorrelated components and treated as independent sources in the analysis. 

The uncertainties in the b-tagging efficiencies measured in dedicated calibration analyses \cite{btag_cal} are also decomposed into uncorrelated components. The large number of components for b-tagging is due to the calibration of the distribution of the BDT discriminant.  

The systematic uncertainties associated with the signal and background processes are accounted for by varying the cross-section of each process within its uncertainty.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                
\section{Fitting Procedure}
\label{sec:fit}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                

The working points discussed in section \ref{btagging} are used to separate events into fit regions based on the highest working point reached by a jet in each event. Because the background composition differs significantly based on the number of b-jets, events are further subdivided into 1 b-jet and 2 b-jet regions in order to minimize the impact of background uncertainties. This gives a total of nine regions: One for the case where no jet passes any working point, and eight for each of the four working points, split into 1 b-jet and 2 b-jet categories.  

A maximum-likelihood fit is performed simultaneously over these nine regions in order to extract the best-fit value of the WZ + b-jet contribution. The WZ + b, WZ + charm and WZ + light contributions are allowed to float, with the remaining background contributions are held fixed. The normalization of the WZ + charm and the WZ + light contributions are taken as systematic uncertainties. The result of the fit is used to extract the cross-section of WZ + heavy-flavor production.

As described in section \ref{sys}, there are 222 systematic uncertainties that are considered as NPs in the fit. These NPs are constrained by Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The
latter are used for normalisation factors to ensure that they are always positive. The expected numbers
of signal and background events are functions of the likelihood. The prior for each NP is added as a penalty term, decreasing the likelihood as it is shifted away from its nominal value. 

The impact of each systematic uncertainty is calculated by performing the fit with the parameter of interest held fixed, varied from its fitted value by its uncertainty, and calculating $\delta\mu$ relative to the baseline fit. The ranking and impact of those nuisance parameters with the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty is shown in figure \ref{fig:ranking}
