\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The production of $WZ$ in association with a heavy flavor jet represents an important test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. While precise measurements have been made of $WZ$ production, $WZ$ + heavy flavor remains poorly understood. This is largely because the QCD processes involved in the production of the b-jet make it difficult to simulate accurately.

This introduces a large uncertainty for analyses that include this process as a background. This includes any analysis with leptons and b-jets in the final state, such as $t\bar{t}H$, $t\bar{t}W$, and $t\bar{t}Z$. Motivated by its relevance to the $t\bar{t}H$ multilepton analysis, we perform a study of the fully leptonic decay mode of this channel, that is, events where both the W and Z decay leptonically. This gives a final state signature of three leptons and at least one jet.

Events with three leptons and one or two jets are sorted into pseudo-continuous b-tagging regions based on the MV2c10 b-tag score of their associated jets. This is done to separate $WZ$ + b-jet events from $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light jets. These regions are fit to data in order make a more accurate estimate of the contribution of $WZ$ + heavy-flavor. The full Run-2 dataset collected by the ATLAS detector, representing 139 $fb^{-1}$ of data from pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, is used for this study.

Section \ref{sec:evt_selection} details the data and Monte Carlo (MC) samples used in the analysis, as well as the event selection applied to these samples. Section \ref{sec:btagging} describes the b-tag algorithm used to identify b-jets and reject charm and light. The multivariate analysis techniques used to separate signal and background are described in section \ref{sec:tZ_bdt}. The

\section{Data Samples and Event Selection}
\label{sec:evt_selection}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The study uses a sample of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector from 2015 through 2018 at an energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, which represents an integrated luminosity of 140 $fb^{-1}$. 

Several different generators were used to produce Monte Carlo simulations of the signal and background processes. For all samples, the response of the ATLAS detector is simulated using Geant4. The WZ signal samples are simulated using Sherpa 2.2.2 \cite{sherpa}. Specific information about the Monte Carlo samples being used can be found in table \ref{tbl:evgen}.

Selected events are required to include exactly three reconstructed light leptons, which have a total charge of $\pm$1. As the opposite sign lepton is found to be prompt 97\% of the time \cite{ttH_paper}, it is required to be loose, while the same sign leptons must be very tight. All leptons are required to be isolated, and pass a non-prompt BDT selection described in \cite{ttH_paper}. The opposite sign lepton is required to have $p_T > 10$ GeV, while the same sign leptons are required to have $p_T > 20$ GeV to reduce the contribution of non-prompt leptons. The leptons must all fall within $|\eta| <$ 2.5.

The invariant mass of at least one pair of opposite sign, same flavor leptons is required to fall within 10 GeV of the mass of the Z boson, 91.2 GeV. Events where one of the opposite sign pairs have an invariant mass less than 12 GeV are rejected in order to suppress low mass resonances. Further, events where the trilepton mass falls within 5 GeV of the Z mass are rejected to remove Z events that include conversions.

An additional requirement is placed on the missing transverse energy, $EE^{miss}_T$ > 20 GeV, and the transverse mass of the $W$ candidate, $m(E^{miss}_T + l_{other}) > 30$ GeV, where $EE^{miss}_T$ is the missing transverse energy, and $l_{other}$ is the lepton not included in he Z-candidate. 

Events are required to have one or two reconstructed jets. Events with more than two jets are rejected in order to reduce the contribution of backgrounds such as $t\bar{t}Z$ and $t\bar{t}W$, which tend to have higher jet multiplicity. Jets are required to have $p_T > 25$ GeV, and must be within $|\eta| <$ 2.47. 

The event yields for both data and Monte Carlo are summarized in table \ref{tab:evt_yields}, which shows good agreement between data and Monte Carlo, and demonstrates that this signal region consists primarily of WZ events.

    \caption{Data and MC yields in the signal region}
    \label{tab:evt_yields}
\end{table}

Here Other $VV$ represents diboson processes other than WZ, and consists predominantly of $ZZ\rightarrow llll$ events where one of the leptons is lost.

Simulations are further validated by comparing the kinematic distributions of the Monte Carlo with data, which are shown in figure \ref{sr_kinematics}.

\section{B-tagging}
\label{sec:btagging}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make a measurement of $WZ$ + b-jet it is necessary to distinguish these events from $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light. For this purpose, the MV2c10 b-tagging algorithm is used to distinguish b-jets from lighter ones. The MV2c10 algorithm uses jet kinematics, particularly jet vertex information, as input for a BDT which assigns each jet a score designed to reflect how likely that jet is to have originated from a b-quark. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.54\linewidth]{MV2c10_output.png}
    \caption{Output distribution of the MV2c10 algorithm for b-jets, charm jets, and light jets}
    \label{fig:MV2c10}
\end{figure}

From the output of the BDT, working points (WPs) are developed based on the efficiency of truth b-jets at particular values of the MV2c10 algorithm. The working points used in this analysis are summarized in table \ref{tab:btag_WPs}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|}
    \hline
       WP &  none & loose & medium & tight & tightest\\
       \hline
     b eff. & - & 85\% & 77\% & 70\% & 60\% \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}    
    \caption{B-tagging Working Points by tightness and b-jet efficiency}
    \label{tab:btag_WPs}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

A tighter WP will accept fewer b-jets, but reject a higher fraction of charm and light jets as shown in figure \ref{fig:jet_rejection}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{btag_rejection_rate.jpg}
    \caption{Light and charm jet rejection rates as a function of b-jet efficiency.}
    \label{fig:jet_rejection}
\end{figure}

Generally, analyses that include b-jets will use a fixed working point, for example, requiring that a jet pass the 70\% threshold. By instead treating these working point as bins, e.g. events with jets that fall between the 85\% and 77\% WPs fall into one bin, while events with jets passing the 60\% WP fall into another, and looking at the full psuedo-continuous MV2c10 spectrum of the jets, additional information can be gained. The psuedo-continuous b-tag spectrum is used in this case to separate out WZ + b, WZ + charm, and WZ + light. 

%Each of these psuedo-continuous working points have been calibrated \cite{btag_cal}, and systematic uncertainties for the continuous working points are included in the analysis, as detailed in section \ref{sec:sys}.

\section{Multivariate Analysis Techniques}
\label{sec:tZ_bdt}
Because it includes an on-shell Z boson as well as a b-jet and W from the top decay, tZ production is the predominant background in the most signal enriched regions. Therefore, a boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm is trained using TMVA \cite{TMVA_guide} to separate $WZ$ + heavy flavor from tZ.

The training samples included only events meeting the requirements of the 1-jet, >60\% region, i.e. passing all the selection described in section \ref{sec:evt_selection} and having exactly one jet which passes the tightest (60\%) MV2c10 working point.

The separation between tZ and $WZ$ + b comes primarily from the reconstructed top candidate invariant mass distribution. 

The following kinematic variables are used as inputs in order to distinguish between these two processes:
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item The invariant mass of the reconstructed top candidate
     \item $p_T$ of each of the leptons
     \item $E_T^{miss}$
     \item Distance between each combination of leptons, $\Delta R (ll)$
     \item Distance between each lepton and the jet, $\Delta R (lj)$
 \end{itemize}

A sample of 20,000 background (tZ) and signal (WZ+b) Monte Carlo events are used to train the BDT. And additional 10,000 events are reserved for testing the model, in order to prevent over-fitting. A total of 750 decision trees with a maximum depth of 8 branches are used to build the model. These parameters are chosen empirically, by training several models with different parameters and selecting the one that gave the best separation for the test sample. 

The results of the BDT training are shown in figure \ref{fig:tZ_bdt}. The output scores for both signal and background events is shown on the left. The right shows the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve that results from the MVA. The ROC curve represents the background rejection as a function of signal efficiency, where each point on the curve represents a different response score. The ROC curve of the BDT is compared to the performance of using an optimal set of flat selections on the same set of input variables.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center
    \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{tZ_bdt/overtrain_BDT.png}%                                     
    \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{tZ_bdt/roc.png}\\
    \caption{Distribution of the BDT response for signal and background events on the left, the ROC curve for the BDT on the right.}
    \label{fig:tZ_bdt}
\end{figure}

These results suggest that some amount of separation can be achieved between these two processes, with a high BDT score selecting a set of events that is pure in $WZ$ + b. Further, the ROC curve demonstrates the BDT performs significantly better than a flat selection.

\section{Signal Region Definitions}
\label{sec:signal_region}

The regions used in the fit are summarized in table \ref{tab:regions}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{A list of the regions used in the fit and the selection used for each.}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}

2j, <85\%	& $N_{jets}$ = 2, jet MV2c10 score < 85\% WP		      \\
2j, 85\%-77\%	& $N_{jets}$ = 2, 85\% WP < jet MV2c10 score < 77\% WP		      \\
2j, 77\%-70\%	& $N_{jets}$ = 2, 77\% WP < jet MV2c10 score < 70\% WP		      \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:regions}
\end{table}

The working points discussed in section \ref{btagging} are used to separate events into fit regions based on the highest working point reached by a jet in each event. Because the background composition differs significantly based on the number of b-jets, events are further subdivided into 1 jet and 2 jet regions in order to minimize the impact of background uncertainties. 

The two jet regions which fall within the tightest MV2c10 working points, between 70\%-60\% and 60\%, are left out of the fit. These regions are found to be dominated by leptonically decaying $t\bar{t}$ with an additional fake lepton. Because these regions add little statistical significance to the measurement while introducing large systematic uncertainties because of the prescence of a fake lepton, these regions are not included.

An additional tZ control region is created based on the BDT described in section \ref{sec:tZ_bdt}. The region with 1-jet passing the 60\% working point is split in two - a signal enriched region of events with a BDT score greater than 0.03, and a tZ control region including events with less than 0.03. This cutoff is arrived at by performing an Asimov fit with a variety of cutoffs, and selecting the value that produces the highest significance for the measurement of $WZ$ + b.

The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is derived from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016 \cite{lumi}.

The experimental uncertainties are related to the reconstruction and identification of light leptons and
 and b-tagging of jets, and to the reconstruction of $E^{miss}_T$. The sources which contribute to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale \cite{jes} are decomposed into uncorrelated components and treated as independent sources in the analysis. 

The uncertainties in the b-tagging efficiencies measured in dedicated calibration analyses \cite{btag_cal} are also decomposed into uncorrelated components. The large number of components for b-tagging is due to the calibration of the distribution of the BDT discriminant.  

The systematic uncertainties associated with the signal and background processes are accounted for by varying the cross-section of each process within its uncertainty.

The full list of systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis is summarized in tables
\ref{Tab:LeptonExperimentalSyst}, \ref{Tab:JetsExperimentalSyst} and \ref{Tab:BTagExperimentalSyst}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------    

A maximum-likelihood fit is performed simultaneously over these eight regions in order to extract the best-fit value of the WZ + b-jet contribution. The $WZ$ + b, $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light contributions are allowed to float, with the remaining background contributions are held fixed. The normalization of the $WZ$ + charm and the $WZ$ + light contributions are taken as systematic uncertainties. The result of the fit is used to extract the cross-section of $WZ$ + heavy-flavor production.

A maximum likelihood fit to data is performed simultaneously in the eight regions described in section \ref{sec:signal_region}. The parameters $\mu_{WZ+b}$, $\mu_{WZ+charm}$, $\mu_{WZ+light}$, where $\mu = \sigma_{observed}/\sigma_{SM} $, are extracted from the fit.

The fit gives a $\mu$ value of $1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}(stat)^{+0.4}_{-0.4}(sys)$ for $WZ$ + b. The fitted cross-section modifiers for $WZ$ + charm and $WZ$ + light are $1.2 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.1$ and $1.04 \pm 0.04 \pm 0.03 $, respectively, consistent with Standard Model predictions. The observed $WZ$ + heavy-flavor inclusive cross-section is $124^{+51}_{-43}(stat)^{+36}_{-35}(sys)$ fb = $124^{+63}_{-56}$ fb. This is calculated based on a model dependant extrapolation to an inclusive region of phase space. The post-fit yields in each region are summarized in figure \ref{fig:fit_regions}:

A post-fit summary plot of the fitted regions is shown in figure \ref{fig:fit_results}:

\end{figure}

As described in section \ref{sec:sys}, there are 226 systematic uncertainties that are considered as NPs in the fit. These NPs are constrained by Gaussian or log-normal probability density functions. The latter are used for normalisation factors to ensure that they are always positive. The expected numbers
of signal and background events are functions of the likelihood. The prior for each NP is added as a penalty term, decreasing the likelihood as it is shifted away from its nominal value. 

The impact of each systematic uncertainty is calculated by performing the fit with the parameter of interest held fixed, varied from its fitted value by its uncertainty, and calculating $\delta\mu$ relative to the baseline fit.  The impact of the most significant systematic uncertainties is summarized in table \ref{tab:systematics}.

    \caption{Summary of the most significant sources of systematic uncertainty.}
    \label{tab:systematics}
\end{table}

The ranking and impact of those nuisance parameters with the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty is shown in figure \ref{fig:ranking}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{all_b/Ranking.png}
    \caption{Impact of systematic uncertainties on the signal-strength of $WZ$ + b}
    \label{fig:ranking}
\end{figure}

The large impact of the Jet Energy Scale and Jet Flavor Tagging is unsurprising, as the shape of the fit regions depends heavily on the modeling of the jets. The pileup-reweighting and luminosity play a significant role as well, because, as shown in figure \ref{fig:signalRegions}, the signal purity is relatively small in each of the fit regions. This means that a small scaling in the background contribution resulting from a change in luminosity or pileup corresponds to a significant change in the best fit signal contribution.

The other major sources of uncertainty come from background modelling and cross-section uncertainty. The pie charts in figure \ref{fig:pie_chart} show that for the modelling uncertainties that contribute most correspond to the most significant backgrounds.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{all_b/PieChart_postFit.png}
    \caption{Background composition of the fit regions.}
    \label{fig:pie_chart}
\end{figure}

The correlations between these nuisance parameters are summarized in figure \ref{fig:corr_mat}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{all_b/CorrMatrix.png}
    \caption{Correlations between nuisance parameters}
    \label{fig:corr_mat}
\end{figure}

The negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+charm}$ and $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ are expected: $WZ$ + charm is present in both the $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light enriched regions, therefore increasing the fraction of charm requires increasing the fraction of $WZ$ + b and $WZ$ + light. This reasoning also explains the positive correlation between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and $\mu_{WZ+light}$. 

Two of the major backgrounds in the region with the highest purity of $WZ$ + b are tZ and Other VV + b, explaining the negative correlations between $\mu_{WZ+b}$ and the tZ cross section, and the VV + b cross section.

The high correlation between the luminosity and $\mu_{WZ+light}$ arises from the fact that the uncertainty on $\mu_{WZ+light}$ is very low (around 4\%). Small changes in luminosity cause a change in the yield of $WZ$ + light that is large compared to its uncertainty, producing a large correlation between these two parameters.

%The other significant correlation present is between ATLAS FTAG L0 and $\mu_{WZ + light}$ and $\mu_{WZ+ charm}$. This shifts the

\section{Top Mass Reconstruction}
\label{sec:topMass}

The top quark is reconstructed from the jet, lepton not included in the Z-candidate, and reconstructed neutrino. Since the selection requires exactly one jet in the event, there is only possible b-jet candidate. 

The neutrino from the W decay is expected to be the only source of $E_T^{miss}$. Therefore, the $E_T$ and $\phi$ of the neutrino are taken from the $E_T^{miss}$ measurement. This leaves the z-component of the neutrino momentum, $p_{\nu z}$ as the only unknown. 

This unknown is solved for by taking the combined invariant mass of the lepton and neutrino to give the invariant mass of the $W$ boson:

\begin{center}
   $(p_l + p_{\nu})^2 = m_W^2$ \\ 
\end{center} 

Written in terms of four-vectors, this equation gives:

The reconstructed top mass distribution for tZ and $WZ$ + b can be seen in figure \ref{fig:topMass}:
